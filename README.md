# Fall-2023-ESE-Database-Management-System
As part of my Enterprise Software Engineering class of my Fall 2023 semester, our professor tasked us with creating a webserver using PHP, HTML, and MySQL that will retrive files from his own server through numerous API calls and migrating them into our own personal phpMyAdmin databases to organize and display the contents of each file. Therefore, this project represents my accumulated knowledge of software engineering at a psuedo-enterprise level.
